  My pets name is <u><i>Goldy</i></u>, he is a goldfish. I got my first goldfish in a carnival and it went through a lot from bag to bottle and, hot to cold temperatures. It had a hard day from all the heat it had to suffer through, but I am very lucky its still alive even though its going to be the 5th year its lived.
